Here I have created a basic Power BI dashboard based on a sales test data. 
In this project I have used data modeling to create relationship with multiple tables present in the test data.
Usage of basic DAX functions to create new values like cost,total quantity and profit which in turn is displayed on the dashboard.
Used various visual tools like stacked bar chart, stacked column chart, pie chart, card, slicer, slicer dropdown menu and filled map.
